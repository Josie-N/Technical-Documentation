# Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL
--------

- [ ] User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
() User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
() User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
